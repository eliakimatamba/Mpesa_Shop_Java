M-Pesa Java SDK

The M-Pesa Java SDK makes it easy to develop Java applications that integrate with the M-Pesa API. The SDK handles the details of making requests and parsing responses from the M-Pesa API, making it quick and easy to get started.

Features

- Easy to use: The SDK takes care of the details of making requests and parsing responses from the M-Pesa API, making it quick and easy to get started.
- Flexible: The SDK is designed to be flexible, allowing you to choose the best way to integrate M-Pesa into your Java application.
- Well documented: The SDK comes with full documentation, making it easy to get started and learn how to use the SDK.

Getting Started

To get started with the M-Pesa Java SDK, you will need:

- A Java development environment
- Maven 3.0 or above

Once you have these set up, you can install the SDK using Maven:

```
$ mvn install
```

You can then include the SDK in your Java project by adding the following dependency to your pom.xml file:

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.mpesa.sdk</groupId>
    <artifactId>mpesa-java-sdk</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

Usage

To use the M-Pesa Java SDK, you will need to create a MpesaClient:

```
import com.mpesa.sdk.MpesaClient;
import com.mpesa.sdk.MpesaClientConfig;

MpesaClientConfig config = new MpesaClientConfig();
config.setConsumerKey("your-consumer-key");
config.setConsumerSecret("your-consumer-secret");
config.setEnvironment(MpesaClientConfig.Environment.SANDBOX);

MpesaClient mpesaClient = new MpesaClient(config);
```

You can then use the MpesaClient to make requests to the M-Pesa API. For example, to create a customer:

```
import com.mpesa.sdk.requests.CreateCustomerRequest;
import com.mpesa.sdk.responses.CreateCustomerResponse;

CreateCustomerRequest request = new CreateCustomerRequest();
request.setFirstName("John");
request.setLastName("Doe");
request.setPhoneNumber("+254711123456");

CreateCustomerResponse response = mpesaClient.createCustomer(request);
```
