The Java M-Pesa Shop is an online store that allows users to purchase items using M-Pesa, a mobile payment system in Kenya. The store will allow users to select items and add them to their shopping cart. When they are ready to checkout, they will be able to pay using M-Pesa. The store will also allow users to track their M-Pesa transactions.

The store will have the following features:
